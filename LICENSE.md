UX Invariants License Agreement
Copyright © CALEB PETERSON

By purchasing, downloading, or using this product (“the Material”), you agree to the following terms.

1. Grant of License
   Subject to the terms of this agreement, you are granted a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to use, copy, and modify the Material for internal use.

This license applies to all tiers, including the Sample and Product tiers.
The license is non-transferable and non-sublicensable, except as explicitly permitted below.

The Sample tier is provided free of charge as a limited, representative subset of the Material for evaluation purposes (“try before you buy”).
Use of the Sample tier is governed by the same restrictions as all other tiers.

The Product tier grants additional rights for inclusion of the Material within an end-user product, as described below.

2. Permitted Uses
   Depending on the tier used or purchased, you may:

Sample Tier

- Use a limited subset of the Material for evaluation and internal use
- Use the Sample Material in personal or internal exploratory projects
- Modify or adapt the Sample Material for internal evaluation purposes

The Sample tier does not grant access to the full Material and does not expand or relax any restrictions defined in this agreement.

Individual Tier

- Use the Material for unlimited personal projects
- Use the Material in client work
- Embed the Material in prompts, configuration files, documentation, and internal tooling
- Modify or adapt the Material for your own use

Team & Company Tiers

- Share the Material internally within your organization
- Use the Material across multiple projects, repositories, and products
- Incorporate the Material into internal standards, guidelines, and onboarding documentation
- Modify or adapt the Material for internal use

Product Tier

- Incorporate the Material, or derivative works of the Material, as an integral and embedded part of an end-user product
- Distribute such end-user products to third parties, provided the Material is not exposed, extractable, or usable as a standalone asset
- Modify or adapt the Material as necessary for integration into the end-user product

The Product tier does not permit redistribution of the Material itself, source-accessible versions, or any form that allows the Material to be separated, reused, or repackaged independently of the end-user product.

3. Restrictions
   You may not:

- Sell, license, or redistribute the Material as a standalone product
- Publish the Material publicly in part or in full (including but not limited to blogs, repositories, courses, or documentation)
- Repackage the Material as a prompt pack, design system, framework, or competing offering
- Use the Material as training data for commercial AI models offered to third parties
- Provide the Material to external parties except as incidental inclusion within compiled software or documentation, or as explicitly permitted under the Product tier

These restrictions apply equally to the Sample tier and all paid tiers, except where explicitly modified by the Product tier.

4. Honor System & Tier Selection
   This product is offered using an honor-based model.

The Sample tier is provided as a free evaluation option.
Continued or expanded use beyond the scope of the Sample tier requires selecting and purchasing an appropriate paid tier.

There is no technical enforcement of organization size, internal sharing, or product distribution.
You agree to select the tier that reasonably reflects:

- The size of the organization using the Material
- The extent of internal sharing
- Whether the Material is used internally, delivered to clients, or embedded in an end-user product
- The value derived from its use

5. Attribution
   Attribution is not required for internal or product use.
   Attribution is appreciated, but not required, if referencing the concepts publicly without reproducing the Material verbatim.

6. Warranty Disclaimer
   The Material is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
   The author makes no guarantees regarding fitness for a particular purpose, correctness, or outcomes resulting from use.

7. Limitation of Liability
   In no event shall the author be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the Material.

8. Termination
   This license terminates automatically if you materially breach its terms.
   Upon termination, you must cease further redistribution of the Material.
   End-user products already distributed under a valid Product tier license are not required to be recalled or disabled.

9. Governing Law
   This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the author’s jurisdiction, without regard to conflict of law principles.

10. Acceptance
    By purchasing, downloading, or using the Material, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this license.
