# NAVIGATION-INV-001: Use clear/consistent iconography and labels

**Category**: Navigation

Navigation elements must use consistent icons and labels so the same destination or action is always recognizable.

## Invariant

Icons and labels used for navigation must be clear, unambiguous, and consistent across the product, and the same destination or action must not be represented by different icon/label combinations.

**Example**: The "Settings" destination always uses the same gear icon and "Settings" label in the sidebar, header menu, and mobile nav.

## Applies When

Any time navigation choices are presented, including global nav, sidebars, menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, toolbars, and in-context navigation links.

**Example**: A list view's tab bar, a product's left nav, and the account dropdown.

## Why This Exists

Consistent iconography and labeling reduce cognitive load, prevent misnavigation, and help users build a reliable mental model of where things live.

**Example**: Reusing the same icon/label for "Reports" helps users find it quickly without re-learning the UI.

## AVOID: Common Violations

Mix icons or labels for the same destination, or use ambiguous icon-only navigation without supporting text or tooltip.

**Example**:

- Using a star icon for "Favorites" in one area and a heart icon in another
- Labeling the same destination as "Projects" in the sidebar and "Workspaces" in the header
- Icon-only nav with no label or tooltip to clarify meaning
